         * This check is built using a system commonly known in the anticheat community as "balance".
         * Essentially, a Minecraft client should run its tick at a minimum of every 50 milliseconds (it may take longer
         * if the game is set to a low framerate or lagging). This means anything under 50ms is typically indicative of
         * cheating. However, ticks may be received more frequently than 50ms apart if:
         * 1. The client recovers from a lag spike. The client may send many sudden "make up ticks" to get back where it
         * should be.
         * 2. The network freezes. Then, it will appear as if many packets appear at once despite them being regularly
         * spaced by the client.
         * Thus, the balance approach was born.
         *
         * The balance approach works like this:
         * 1. When a tick packet is received, it gives the player 50 balance (representing the 50ms gap).
         * 2. When a tick packet is received, it reduces the player's balance by the amount of ms elapsed since the
         * last tick. This should regularly result in balance returning to 0.
         * 3. There is a minimum threshold balance cannot go under to prevent abuse by repeatedly slowing and speeding
         * the game. This is, by default, at 3 seconds (-3000 balance).
         * 4. There is a maximum threshold balance cannot go over. This is how many milliseconds ahead the client should
         * be able to go at maximum. This is, by default, at 150 balance.
         *
         * This is an extremely basic version of the common balance check and could be improved with lag-spike
         * detections, but for now this will do!
